/*!

A `Sort` is a named type. `Sort`s can be related to each other via a subsort relation, which in the
absence of error conditions is a partial order.

See the module level documentation for the [`sort`](crate::core::sort) for more about
sorts, kinds, and the subsort relation, and how they are represented in this codebase.

## Lifecycle and Ownership

Sorts are owned by the `Module` in which they are defined, *not* by a `Kind` or adjacency list. Once
the subsort lattice is constructed (that is, the `Kind`s and the adjacency lists in the `Sort`s),
it is immutable for the lifetime of the sorts (equivalently, for the lifetime of the `Module`).

## Optimizations for Computing the Subsort Relation

See [the module level documentation](crate::core::sort), specifically the
section titled, "Optimizations for Computing a Subsort Relation at Runtime."

## See Also...

 - A [`SortSpec`](crate::core::sort::sort_spec::SortSpec) is a generalization of `Sort` that additionally permits
   functors.
 - A ['Kind'](crate::core::sort::kind::Kind) is a connected component of the lattice of `Sort`s induced by the subsort
   relation.
