# `mod2lib`: A pattern matching and term rewriting library

The `mod2lib` library builds on lessons learned in writing [`Mod`](https://github.com/rljacobson/Mod) and
[`mod2`](https://github.com/rljacobson/mod2) to bring advanced pattern matching algorithms to Rust.

It is a work in progress and is not yet functional.

# Examples

In the `examples` directory you will find examples of how to use this library. The `examples/wl_example` example 
implements a little language similar to Wolfram Language called _WL_.
