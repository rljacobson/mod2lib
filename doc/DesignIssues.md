# Design and Implementation Challenges

## 1. Generic Interface
The challenge is to design an interface that is generic enough to be applicable for a wide range of applications. At the same time, it should allow for shared implementation and data members, which can make it more efficient and easier to maintain.

## 2. Graph Data Structures
Constructing graph data structures like trees and directed acyclic graphs is needed for CONS hashing and subexpression sharing. The challenge lies in achieving this while respecting Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, which are quite strict.

## 3. Memory Management
Efficient memory management is crucial for the graph data structures. This may involve implementing garbage collection, using reference counting, or something more sophisticated to ensure memory is handled properly without leaks or dangling references.

## 4. Parallelism and Concurrency
Adding parallelism and concurrency could significantly improve performance, but it adds complexity. The challenge is to determine if and how concurrency can be applied to the rewriting tasks, given the inherent difficulty of working with shared mutable state in Rust.

## 5. Sort / Kind System
Deciding on a sort or kind system (a type system) is another key challenge. A crucial decision is whether to implement this from the start or add it incrementally later. This system will affect how terms are classified and validated within the rewriting process.
